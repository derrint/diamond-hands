          <h2>Latest update on 17 August 2021</h2>

          <p>These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you") and DIH Limited (“we", “us", or “our") concerning your access to and use of the www.DIH.com website and the DIH app as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site" and the “App"). DIH is a distributed application that is currently running on the Ethereum Network, Loom Network and Ronin Network (the "Blockchains"), using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to own, transfer, battle, and breed genetically unique digital creatures. It also enables users to own and transfer other digital assets like plots of land and items. These assets can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with the Site. The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “App”. Using the App, users can view their assets and use the Smart Contracts to acquire, trade, battle, and breed creatures with other App users.</p>

          <p>WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE AND/OR ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE, THE APP AND THE SMART CONTRACTS AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>

          <p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site, the App, and the Smart Contracts from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert you of any changes by updating the “Last Updated" date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms of Use to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site, the App, and the Smart Contracts after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.</p>

          <p>The information on the Site, the App and the Smart Contracts are not intended for distribution to or used by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site and/or the App from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance of local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

          <p>The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. People under the age of 18 are not permitted to use or register for the Site, the App, and the Smart Contracts.</p>
